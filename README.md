# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-on-Lung-Cancer-Dataset
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a lung cancer dataset to identify key patterns and insights related to lung cancer risk factors. Additionally, machine learning models are developed to predict lung cancer occurrence based on these features.
