## üìå Project Title:
**Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Lung Cancer Dataset**

---

## üìù Project Description:
This project aims to perform an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a lung cancer dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that may contribute to better understanding of the factors associated with lung cancer occurrence.

Additionally, machine learning models are built to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on the dataset features, demonstrating practical applications of the analysis.

## üîç EDA Process Overview:

1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the Excel file using Pandas.
2. **Data Inspection**: 
   - Checked shape, data types, and initial rows.
   - Verified missing values.
3. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Converted categorical features.
   - Handled any inconsistencies or typos if found.
4. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Plotted bar charts, countplots for categorical features.
   - Histogram for age distribution.
5. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Cross-tabulation between features and lung cancer status.
   - Heatmap to show feature correlation.
6. **Multivariate Analysis**:
   - Pairplots and correlation matrices to check feature relationships.
7. **Insights and Observations**:
   - Smoking, alcohol, yellow fingers, fatigue, and wheezing show strong association with lung cancer.
   - Certain symptoms like chest pain and coughing are more frequent in lung cancer patients.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model Building:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training:**
   - **Logistic Regression** used as baseline classifier.
   - **Random Forest Classifier** applied for better performance.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

4. **Results:**
   - Logistic Regression Accuracy

## üìå Key Findings:

- Majority of lung cancer cases are associated with **fatigue, yellow fingers, and alcohol consumption**.
- Features like **wheezing, coughing, and chest pain** appear prominently in positive lung cancer cases.
